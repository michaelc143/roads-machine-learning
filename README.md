# This project is used to make a machine learning model that can identify if an image of a road is dirty or clean

- To get started, clone this repository by running the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/michaelc143/roads-machine-learning.git
```

This will create a local directory with all the files you need to get started.

-To start working with the project, make sure you have python installed:

```bash
python3 -v
```

- Also, make sure you have pip installed:

```bash
pip -V
```

- Once you have python and pip installed, install the dependencies using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This will install all the required dependencies needed to run the project.

- To run the model creation process, run the following command:

```bash
python3 roads.py
```

- The roads.py file outputs a model to road_classifier_model.keras, currently this model has scored:

```bash
Test loss: 0.3430, Test accuracy: 0.8889
```
